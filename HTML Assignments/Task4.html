            THE RESEARCH PAPER
            There will come a time in most students' careers when they are assigned a research paper. Such an assignment often creates a great deal of unneeded anxiety in the student, which may result in procrastination and a feeling of confusion and inadequacy. This anxiety frequently stems from the fact that many students are unfamiliar and inexperienced with this genre of writing. Never fear—inexperience and unfamiliarity are situations you can change through practice! Writing a research paper is an essential aspect of academics and should not be avoided on account of one's anxiety. In fact, the process of writing a research paper can be one of the more rewarding experiences one may encounter in academics. What is more, many students will continue to do research throughout their careers, which is one of the reasons this topic is so important.</p>
    <p>Becoming an experienced researcher and writer in any field or discipline takes a great deal of practice. There are few individuals for whom this process comes naturally. Remember, even the most seasoned academic veterans have had to learn how to write a research paper at some point in their career. Therefore, with diligence, organization, practice, a willingness to learn (and to make mistakes!), and, perhaps most important of all, patience, students will find that they can achieve great things through their research and writing.</p>
    <p>A research paper destined for submission to a peer-reviewed journal may not require meticulous copy-editing if the target journal offers this service routinely for accepted manuscripts. Moreover, some authors prefer that the AE concentrate on improving language, style and content. Not having to venture into the copy-editing part of the editing continuum (checking that references, tables and figures are formatted correctly, for example) certainly saves time and therefore money, and allows the AE to focus on aspects of the text that are generally outside the copy editor’s remit. But even if copy-editing is not specifically requested, the AE should do some formatting. The most elementary is ensuring a consistent spelling style (either US or UK, not a mix). If the publisher’s house style is known, the AE should ensure it is followed. And if a journal has complex instructions to authors, an AE may help authors follow them (but since this service implies extra time, it is more likely to be offered by an in-house AE).</p>
     <p>Our main interest in testing Mobile Apps is Black-Box functional testing of mobile apps. As such, we are not interested in other testing activities for Mobile Apps, such as usability testing, configuration testing, exception handling testing, etc. This is reflected in how we review the literature. We first survey approaches for MBT for testing Mobile Apps. Then, we quickly review major approaches for test automation, primarily to determine what options we have to turn the tests generated by an MBT approach into executable tests.</p>

        <h1>Section 2</h1>
        <p>The research paper is a common rite of passage in the academic world. While students are typically successful at amassing information sources, many grapple with new conventions of academic discourse and the synthesis of these foreign concepts into their own writing. Furthermore, research assignment guidelines that focus on the number or type of sources can lead students to view information as an object, and to conceive of research as a bounded, static product rather than grasping the dynamic and collaborative nature of inquiry.</p>
        <p>Social bookmarking sites such as Diigo can help shift the focus from a final product to the experience of inquiry, as well as repositioning research as active dialog. First, Diigo enables the quick and easy bookmarking of the various informal conversations that lead to formal scholarship. Students’ exposure to conversation in context (blogs, tweets, discussion) breaks down academic barriers by helping their understanding of research as an active conversation. This focus on the context also means that students can provide much more purposeful critical evaluation of sources rather than following teacher-imposed criteria. Second, the participatory nature of social bookmarking in the class Diigo library mimics the interconnected nature of research and the social construction of knowledge. By enabling students to work collaboratively and draw on other students’ work and expertise, research becomes more active and meaningful. Finally, the social nature of Diigo means that students are curating a set of topical resources within a community as one would in civic, social, or academic environments. This provides an audience beyond the teacher, making research activities more authentic.</p>
   <p>A theoretical research paper’s results are the proofs and theorems generated. You should not document every proof; only highlight significant or interesting proofs as theorems. If it is necessary to build up a theorem then you need to specify any necessary lemmata. Often the contribution is the development and explanation of the theory. However, sometimes a theory can be exercised to produce or highlight results that are worth sharing with the wider audience. Often this is in the form of a model or simulation; see Chapter 8, Using Simulation for Research, for further details.

    In the results section of your paper, explain what you found after you performed your analysis. Creating tables to show results is an efficient and effective method. You can also show pictures of interesting results, that is if a data anomaly occurred or to display the distributions of the data samples. Regardless of whether or not you are generating datasets, you should make sure and explain the impact, implications, and reach of the theoretical research. Are there any limitations of scope, impact, applicability, and so on</p>

        <h1>Section 3</h1>
        <p>A research paper is a type of academic writing that provides an in-depth analysis, evaluation, or interpretation of a single topic, based on empirical evidence. Research papers are similar to analytical essays, except that research papers emphasize the use of statistical data and preexisting research, along with a strict code for citations. 

            Research papers are a bedrock of modern science and the most effective way to share information across a wide network. However, most people are familiar with research papers from school; college courses often use them to test a student’s knowledge of a particular area or their research skills in general. 
            
            Considering their gravity, research papers favor formal, even bland language that strips the writing of any bias. Researchers state their findings plainly and with corresponding evidence so that other researchers can consequently use the paper in their own research. 
            
            Keep in mind that writing a research paper is different from writing a research proposal. Essentially, research proposals are to acquire the funding needed to get the data to write a research paper. </p>

            <p>A research paper is not that easy to generate and definitely not in one semester. Consequently, only a precise template for writing research papers is elaborated down to details, and students are asked to bring their previously concluded research rewritten according to the template just described. Students without previous research experience are given an opportunity, in a follow-up research-oriented course, to do a research project and to write a research paper from scratch.

                In the course described here, one can only teach theoretical issues (see Refs. [9,10]), and one can encourage students, for extra homework credit, to write a research paper about their research conducted before the course started, using the formalism taught, step by step. Therefore, homework #8 is optional, for extra classroom credit.</p>
                <p>The research paper remains the most common writing assignment on college campuses, more popular than ever (Lunsford, 2008). In the first year, just as students are encountering the conventions of academic writing, we also hope to ground them in the mechanics of using a print/digital hybrid library, probably much larger than any they’ve ever used before, to make informed choices among possible sources, and extract meaning from them in order to support a well-organized synthesis or argument. We know they will be asked to do this in the future, so we try to get them acculturated quickly.</p>

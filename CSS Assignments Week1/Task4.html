            The national flag of India, also known as the "Tiranga" (meaning tricolor), is a symbol of the country's sovereignty and identity. It consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width. The top stripe is saffron, representing courage and sacrifice. The middle stripe is white, symbolizing truth, peace, and purity. The bottom stripe is green, representing faith, valor, and fertility.
            In the center of the white stripe, there is a navy blue Ashoka Chakra (wheel) with 24 spokes. The Ashoka Chakra signifies the dharma (duty) and represents the law of dharma governing the life force. The navy blue color symbolizes the sky and the limitless potential of the nation.

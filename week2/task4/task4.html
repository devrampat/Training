        <h2>Haiku</h2>
        <p>
          The haiku (or hokku) is an ancient form of Japanese poetry that has
          become very popular all over the world. Renowned for its small size,
          haikus consist of just three lines (tercet); the first and third lines
          have five syllables, whereas the second has seven. Haikus don't have
          to rhyme and are usually written to evoke a particular mood or
          instance. So, you can have a lot of fun with them! You may have
          written or will find yourself writing your own haiku at some point in
          school, or you can get creative and try it at home, too.

        <h2>Sonnet</h2>
        <p>
          This very old form of poetry was made famous by none other than
          William Shakespeare, but the sonnet actually originated in 13th
          century Italy where it was perfected by the poet Petrarch. The word
          'sonnet' is derived from the Italian word 'sonnetto' which means
          'little song'. Traditionally, sonnets are made up of 14 lines and
          usually deal with love. As a rule, Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets follow
          an ABBA ABBA CDE CDE rhyme scheme, whereas Shakespearean (English)
          sonnets are typically ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. But of course, rules are made
          to be broken!

        <h2>Limerick</h2>
        <p>
          Limericks are funny (and sometimes rude!) poems which were made
          popular by Edward Lear in the 19th century. They have a set rhyme
          scheme of AABBA, with lines one, two and five all being longer in
          length than lines three and four. The last line is often the
          punchline. Their sound is very distinctive, it's likely you've heard
          or read one before!
